1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Merge Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Merge Request in once you have the sign-off of another developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.
